# crypto_clustering

As a Senior Manager at the Advisory Services team on a Big Four firm. One of my most important clients, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrencies investment portfolio for its customers, however, they are lost in the immense universe of cryptocurrencies. I was tasked to help them make sense of it all by generating a report of what cryptocurrencies are available on the trading market and how they can be grouped using classification.
In this homework assignment, i used my new unsupervivsed learning and Amazon SageMaker skills into action by clustering cryptocurrencies and creating plots to present your results.
I accomplished the following main tasks:


Data Preprocessing: 

I Prepared data for dimension reduction with PCA and clustering using K-Means.


Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA: 

I Reduced data dimension using the PCA algorithm from sklearn.


Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-Means: 

I Predicted clusters using the cryptocurrencies data using the KMeans algorithm from sklearn.


Visualizing Results: 

I Created some plots and data tables to present your result
